# RepRap µDelta Hacks

This is a collection of hacks (and useful information) for the [RepRap µDelta], an open source 3d printer.

The µDelta community is mostly active in France, so information exchange isn't easy (as long as you don't understand French). Still, I think the µDelta is a great printer and there's a lot to find out, modify or improve.

This repository is a collection (in English) of notable stuff I found out (on the web or by myself) and notes on improvements/hacks I did to my printer.

Feel free to post your comments/ideas to the issues section if you happen to also own a µDelta printer.
